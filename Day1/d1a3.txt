Datatypes in Javascript

There are two types of datatypes in Javascript:
o Primitive data type
o Non- primitive data type

>>PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
1. String- represents sequence of characters.
Eg: let str="Hello world";

2. Number- represents numeric values. It can have both integer and floating point numbers. Many operations can be performed like +, -, *, /, etc.
Eg: let n=1234;
       n=12.345;

3. Boolean- represents boolean value either True or False.
Eg: let isGreater= 4>1;
      alert(isGreater);

4. Undefined- represents undefined value.
Eg: let age;
      alert(age);

5. Null- represents null i.e. no value at all.
Eg: var person= null;

>>NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
1. Object- represents instance through which we can access members. JavaScript objects are written with curly braces { }. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
Eg: var person = {Name:"Raghav", age: 20, City: Pune};

2. Array- represents group of similar values. JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas.
Eg: var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

3. Function- The function is callable object that executes a block of code.
Eg: var greeting = function()
	{ 
       		return "Hello World!"; 
      	}
	alert(typeof greeting)
	alert(greeting());
